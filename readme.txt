Add custom JavaScript to your site from an editor in the WordPress admin

###Description

Add custom JavaScript to your site from an editor in the WordPress admin.

Your code is stored and revisioned with a custom post type, so you can always go back to a previous working state.

This work is a fork from Automattic's Custom Javascript Editor.


###Installation

1. Upload the `new-custom-javascript-editor` folder to your plugins directory (e.g. `/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
