Add custom JavaScript to your site from an editor in the WordPress admin

== Description ==

Add custom JavaScript to your site from an editor in the WordPress admin.

Your code is stored and revisioned with a custom post type, so you can always go back to a previous working state.

This work is a fork from Automattic's Custom Javascript Editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `custom-javascript-editor` folder to your plugins directory (e.g. `/wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.2 =
* Don't output custom javascript on the login page, thanks Carl Danley.

= 1.1 =
* The editor has a syntax highlighter with configurable themes. jQuery Masonry is also bundled.

= 1.0 =
Enqueue any bundled JavaScript libraries on the frontend for use. Register your own with the 'cje_available_scripts' filter.

== Changelog ==
